ENTER A VALID IP AND PORT
AND IT WILL PING THE REQUEST IP
THIS IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR A 'DDOS' DO NOT USE IT FOR THAT.

ANY UNETHICAL USE OF THIS PINGER IS DONE BY USER DISCRESTION AND IS NOT ENDORSED, NOR 'COOL'.

THIS PINGER WAS MADE TO UNDERSTAND NETWORKING MONITORING PROCESSES OF IPS AND THEIR SPECIFIC PORTS.
